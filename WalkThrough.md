## üé¨ **SCRIPT SEGMENTS**

### **0:00 - 0:30 | Introduction & Project Overview**

> *"Hello! I'm [Your Name], and today I'll walk you through my Product Catalog Manager - a full-stack application demonstrating modern software architecture and best practices."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show project directory structure
- Highlight key files: `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`, `UML_Diagrams.md`

> *"This is a React frontend with Spring Boot backend, PostgreSQL database, all containerized with Docker. Let me show you how it runs and demonstrate the key features."*

---

### **0:30 - 1:15 | Setup & Architecture Demonstration**

> *"First, let's see how easy it is to get this running. One command starts everything:"*

**Screen Actions:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> *"This starts the React frontend on port 3000, Spring Boot API on port 8080, and PostgreSQL on port 5432. The architecture follows clean separation of concerns - React handles the UI, Spring Boot provides RESTful APIs, and PostgreSQL stores the data."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show running containers
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
- Show the main application interface

---

### **1:15 - 2:30 | Core Features Demonstration**

> *"Let me demonstrate the core functionality. Here's the product list with server-side pagination - notice how smoothly it handles large datasets. I can adjust the page size from 5 to 200 records per page."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show product list with pagination controls
- Change page size dropdown
- Demonstrate search functionality

> *"The search is debounced and searches across product name, brand, and model. Now let's look at the brand analytics - this shows product counts by brand with real-time filtering."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Navigate to Brand Summary
- Show search functionality in brand summary
- Demonstrate sorting capabilities

> *"Let me show you the product details. Clicking on any product opens a detailed view with all information. And here's the add product form with comprehensive validation."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Click on a product to show details
- Navigate to Add Product form
- Show validation in action (try submitting empty form)

---

### **2:30 - 3:30 | Technical Implementation Highlights**

> *"Now let me show you the technical implementation. Here's the Spring Boot API with comprehensive Swagger documentation:"*

**Screen Actions:**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- Show API endpoints and documentation

> *"Notice the clean RESTful design with proper HTTP methods, comprehensive validation, and structured error responses. The backend uses Spring Boot 3.2.6 with Jakarta Validation, JPA, and custom exception handling."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show ProductController endpoints
- Demonstrate API testing in Swagger

> *"The frontend is built with React 19 using modern hooks, Material-UI components, and a centralized API service. Let me show you the error handling and loading states."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show loading states during API calls
- Demonstrate error boundaries
- Show responsive design on different screen sizes

---

### **3:30 - 4:15 | Advanced Features & Code Quality**

> *"Let me highlight some advanced features. The application includes comprehensive error handling with global exception management, environment-based configuration, and performance optimizations like debounced search."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show error handling (try invalid API calls)
- Show configuration files
- Demonstrate search debouncing

> *"The codebase follows enterprise patterns with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and documentation. Here's the UML architecture diagram I created to show the system design."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show UML_Diagrams.md
- Highlight key architectural decisions

---

### **4:15 - 4:45 | Testing & Quality Assurance**

> *"Quality is paramount. The backend includes unit tests for the service layer, and the frontend has component tests. Let me show you the test coverage:"*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show backend test files
- Show frontend test files
- Run a quick test to demonstrate

> *"The application includes comprehensive validation, both client-side and server-side, ensuring data integrity and user experience."*

---

### **4:45 - 5:00 | Conclusion & Future Vision**

> *"This project demonstrates my approach to full-stack development: clean architecture, modern technologies, comprehensive testing, and user-centric design. The roadmap shows enterprise-level thinking with features like microservices, AI integration, and multi-tenancy."*

**Screen Actions:**
- Show README roadmap section
- Highlight key technical decisions

> *"The application is production-ready with Docker containerization, environment configuration, and comprehensive documentation. Thank you for your time - I'm happy to answer any questions about the implementation!"*
